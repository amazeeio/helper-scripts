# amazee.io Helper scripts

This is a collection of scripts that used to live in the Lagoon repository, and are useful for administering Lagoon installations.

They have been split from the main Lagoon repository (https://github.com/amazeeio/lagoon) as they may not be broadly applicable to all Lagoon installs.

Additionally, A number of them have not been updated for Kubernetes compatibility, so may only apply to Openshift 3.
